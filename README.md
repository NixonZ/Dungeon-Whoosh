# Dungeon-Whoosh
 A simple text-based RPG made in C++, compiled using g++. *GPL v3.*
 
 The game is not ready yet (perhaps it won't ever be).
 
 It was started for a school project, by Nixonz and GitHG22. We don't know the whole of C++ so there might be better ways of doing things than the workaround we chose, so feel free to open an issue and tell us about it. If we could understand enough, we would push the changes. And, your name will inducted in the Hall of Fame.
